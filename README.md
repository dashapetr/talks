My Talks
===================

Hi!

I talk sometimes.

This repository will host most (if not all) of the talks (conferences, presentations, podcasts, etc) that I've given or was a guest of.

Many thanks to [Julia Furst Morgado](https://github.com/juliafmorgado) for the inspiration to create this repo.
